# 5CA7

This is the custom scenery pack for 5CA7 by Fox.

If you're viewing this on the github webpage, press the green "download" button above this not (over on the right side). Doing so will let you download a zip file with all three folders:
- 5CA7 roads   (better aligned roads. Optional but recommended)
- 5CA7 scenery pack by me (a modified version of the gateway scenery)
- 5CA7 default scenery pack (this will be included in the zip but you can ignore it)

The zip file will include all three folders. You only need two folders - you can discard the default scenery pack - it is already included in XP 11.05 and later.
