# 5CA7

This is the custom scenery pack for 5CA7 by Fox.

If you're viewing this on the github webpage, press the green "download" button above this not (over on the right side). Doing so will let you download a zip file with two folders:
- 5CA7 roads   (better aligned roads. Optional but recommended)
- 5CA7 scenery pack by me (a modified version of the gateway scenery)

The zip file will include both folders. Put both folders in your XPlane custom scenery folder and start XPlane. If you view 5CA7 and there are no buildings or trees then quick XPlane and edit your scenery INI file so that 5CA7 roads is immediately BELOW the scenery pack in the INI file. Save the INI and restart XPlane. The scenery buildings should now appear above the roads and everything should appear as intended.
